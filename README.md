1. Open Command Prompt (CMD) on your computer.
2. Change the directory to the desired location where you want to create the file structure. For example, if you want to create it under your name, you can use the following command:

   ```
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername
   ```

   Replace "YourUsername" with your actual username.

3. Create a folder with your name using the following command:

   ```
   mkdir YourName
   ```

   Replace "YourName" with your desired folder name.

4. Change the directory to the newly created folder:

   ```
   cd YourName
   ```

   Replace "YourName" with the actual folder name you chose.

5. Create a folder named "operating system" using the following command:

   ```
   mkdir "operating system"
   ```

6. Change the directory to the "operating system" folder:

   ```
   cd "operating system"
   ```

7. Create the five directories inside the "operating system" folder using the following commands:

   ```
   mkdir "memory management"
   mkdir "processor management"
   mkdir "file management"
   mkdir "security"
   mkdir "error detection management"
   ```

8. Change the directory to the "memory management" folder:

   ```
   cd "memory management"
   ```

9. Create the "midterm" and "final grade" directories using the following commands:

   ```
   mkdir "midterm"
   mkdir "final grade"
   ```

10. Change the directory to the "midterm" folder:

    ```
    cd "midterm"
    ```

11. Create the five directories for quizzes using the following commands:

    ```
    mkdir "quiz 1"
    mkdir "quiz 2"
    mkdir "quiz 3"
    mkdir "quiz 4"
    mkdir "quiz 5"
    ```

12. Change the directory to "quiz 1" folder:

    ```
    cd "quiz 1"
    ```

13. Create the "laboratory 1" and "laboratory 2" folders using the following commands:

    ```
    mkdir "laboratory 1"
    mkdir "laboratory 2"
    ```

You have now created the desired file directory structure. Please note that the commands provided above are for Windows operating systems. If you are using a different operating system, the commands might vary slightly.
